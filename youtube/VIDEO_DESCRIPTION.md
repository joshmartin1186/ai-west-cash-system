## Description Best Practices

### Hook (First 2 Lines - Critical)
- Must be compelling when truncated at "Show More"
- Create curiosity or promise specific value
- No generic intros like "In this video..."
- Make every word count

**Good Examples:**
```
15% reply rate on LinkedIn outreach. No hired SDRs.
Here's the exact AI system that books 10+ meetings per week.
```

```
Most people waste 20 hours/week on manual CRM updates.
I built an AI that does it in real-time from call transcripts.
```

**Bad Examples:**
```
In this video, I'm going to show you how to use AI for outreach.
This is really helpful for anyone who wants to improve their results.
```

### Timestamps
- Start at 0:00 with "Intro" or hook summary
- Mark every major section change
- Be specific about what's in each section
- Use timestamps viewers can click
- Include "Recap & Next Steps" at end

### Template CTA
- Always include if video has associated template
- Direct Gumroad link (shortened if needed)
- One sentence about what's included
- Position before or after timestamps (test both)

### Links Section
- Only include links actually mentioned in video
- Keep descriptions brief (2-4 words max)
- Use shortened URLs if very long
- Group by type (tools, resources, references)

### Tags/Keywords
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Include primary topic (#ai, #automation)
- Include specific tools mentioned (#claude, #n8n)
- Include outcome-focused terms (#productivity)
- Don't spam tags - be strategic
